## Key Topics and Structures

### 1. ASP.Net MVC Framework:

ASP.Net MVC is a framework built on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. In this project, the MVC architecture is used to ensure the code is organized and manageable.

### 2. Entity Framework Db First Approach:
Entity Framework is an ORM technology that acts as a bridge between the database and application code. In this project, the Db First approach is used to generate models from an existing database.

### 3. MVC Architecture:
The MVC architecture separates an application's business logic, user interface, and user interactions into distinct layers. This structure makes the application more modular and testable.

### 4. LINQ Queries:
LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is used for querying data in .NET, making database operations more readable and concise.

### 5. CRUD Operations:
The project provides the necessary infrastructure to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database.

### 6. Authentication and Authorization:
To develop a secure web application, user authentication and authorization mechanisms have been implemented.
